# Coding Tasks
This is a couple of tasks for my CoGrammar software engineering bootcamp.

## Linked lists
In `linked_list.py` I have made an implementation of a linked list that uses
some magic methods and tries to mimic some of the functionality of a python
list. When run directly it showcases a couple of use cases for the class.

Implementing a linked list shows my understanding of said topic and also shows
adaptability by making the class use magic methods to make it easier to use
with python syntax.

## Dijkstra's shortest Path
In `shortest_path.py` I have made an implementation of dijkstra's algorithm
on a graph, which i also implemented. Currently it is incomplete
